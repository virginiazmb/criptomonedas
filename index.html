            <h1 class="display-4">WHY USE TETHER?</h1>
            <h5>Launched in 2014, Tether tokens (USD₮) pioneered the stablecoin model and are the most widely traded. Tether tokens offer the stability and simplicity of fiat currencies coupled with the innovative nature of blockchain technology, representing a perfect combination of both worlds.</h5>

            benefits as the most stable, liquid and trusted stablecoin.</h5>

            <h1>WHAT ARE TETHER TOKENS AND HOW DO THEY WORK?</h1>
            <p>Tether tokens are assets that move across the blockchain just as easily as other digital currencies but that are pegged to real-world currencies on a 1-to-1 basis.

            Tether tokens are referred to as stablecoins because they offer price stability as they are pegged to a fiat currency. This offers traders, merchants and funds a low volatility solution when exiting positions in the market.
                
            All Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency (e.g., 1 USD₮ = 1 USD) and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves.
                
            As a fully transparent company, we publish a record of the current reserve assets.</p>
            <p>A lawyer for Tether Limited said in 2019 that 74% of USDT tokens were backed by cash or cash equivalents. But when Tether Limited provided a breakdown of its reserves in 2021, only 2.9% of USDT tokens were backed by cash. The rest of its reserves consisted of secured loans, corporate bonds, and commercial paper.

            To sum it up, Tether Limited claims that all USDT is 100% backed by the company's reserves. These reserves are a mix of assets, so it's not all cash. It's also worth noting that there's no legal guarantee a USDT token will be redeemable for $1.</p>

            <h1 class="display-2">TRANSPARENCY</h1>
            <p>All Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves.
            The value of our reserves is published daily and updated at least once per day.</p>

            <h1 class="display-5">How do I know my Tether tokens are secure?</h1>
            <p>Tether is built on top of the revolutionary and cryptographically secure open blockchain technologies and adheres to strict security and global government laws and regulations.

            All Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency (e.g., 1 USD₮ = 1 USD) and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves. As a fully transparent company, we publish a daily record of our bank balances and the value of our reserves.
                
            Tether tokens can be securely stored, sent and received across the blockchain and are redeemable for cash (the underlying pegged asset) pursuant to Tether Limited’s terms of service.</p>
